                <p>Imagine a life without a motherâ€¦, life just seems difficult even with your father by your side. A life without both parents is the worst a kid could have. That is why here at christian helping hands led by <a href="#">Larry White</a>, we try our very best to give children with this kind of misfortune a surrounding  where they feel welcome and a feeling of security until probably a family comes for them.</p>
                <p>Education is an important part of human life. Education gives meaning to our life as it enables the growth and development of our mind and intellect. An educated society is an enlightened and empowered one. Such a society can make well-informed choices in its social, political and economic welfare and as the popular saying goes, <span>"Education is the key to success"</span>, we at Christian Helping Hands (CHH), try to provide the best of education to these children so that they don't feel less privileged of themselves and also grow up to become good and patriotic citizens to their countries and also be of good use to society.</p>
                <p>The first layer protecting the human body and providing it with shelter is clothing. Hence, clothing in CHH is very fundamental as we want the kids to have the best of clothes for school and other domestic and social gatherings.</p>
