                <h3>Help & Support</h3>
                <p>What does God say about orphan care? He says a lot, actually! He cares deeply for them, and mentions orphans several times throughout scripture. God says that HE is the father to the fatherless (Ps. 68:5), that He sustains the fatherless (Ps. 146:9). So those are a few things that God has said about orphans, but what is our responsibility in the matter? He calls us to care for and protect them. In Psalm 82:3 it says, “Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute.”</p>

                <h3>Adoption</h3>
                <p>The act of adopting a child comes with positive benefits and fiscal responsibility, such as government assistance and wiser spending.If you want to provide a child with a loving home and family, you probably have the right motivations for adopting a child, especially if your primary goal is to make your home a loving place. The best homes for adoptive children include families that are not only accepting but also want to exchange family traditions, share their faith, and make memories. It also means accepting children for who they are even their faults, and understanding that they have a history and a heritage that needs to be respected and embraced.</p>

                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>A good education system produces good citizens who are well educated, well mannered and disciplined. Orphans and vulnerable children stand in particular need of an education intervention as they are amongst the children most in danger of becoming infected with HIV due to economic hardship, reduced parental care and protection and increased susceptibility to abuse and exploitation.</p>

                <h3>Volunteer</h3>
                <p>One being selfless and giving their time and energy to help others. It's a way to contribute to society without expecting any monetary rewards. This experience requires willingness and planning. For anyone to have such an experience, they have to move out of their comfort zone.</p>
